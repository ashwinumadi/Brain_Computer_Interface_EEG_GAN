Hey!
Due to vast amount of memory needed to store all the datasets, we are not able to upload all the datasets collected in this repository.
The pickle files added here contain few of the datasets recorded.

# Folders : 
	1. Datasets : Images given for EEG signals. 
	2. GAN_basic_shapes : The images generated during training are stored here.
	3. Chikoo : Contains the images that are generated during the testing phase. - (After test.py file execution)


# Files : 
	1. train.py : Run this file first. GAN model training. 
	2. test.py : Run this file second. GAN model testing.
	3. eeg_discriptions_shapes_red.py : Code for EEG signals classifications. No need to Run.
	4. train_test_split.py : Spliting the data, No need to run.
